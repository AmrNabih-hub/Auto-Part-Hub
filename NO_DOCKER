This project does not use Docker.

If you are seeing Docker-related errors during deployment:

1. Use nixpacks builder (see nixpacks.toml)
2. Use native Node.js + PHP deployment
3. DO NOT auto-generate Dockerfiles
4. Use the railway.toml configuration for Railway
5. Use the vercel.json configuration for Vercel

For Railway: Make sure builder is set to "nixpacks"
For Vercel: Use the buildCommand in vercel.json
For other platforms: Use native Node.js + PHP runtime

Docker has been intentionally removed from this project.

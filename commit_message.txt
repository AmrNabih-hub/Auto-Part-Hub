feat: Prepare application for Railway deployment and add admin seeding

This commit includes several key changes to prepare the application for
successful deployment on Railway and introduces a new admin user seeding
capability:

- **Frontend Deployment Configuration:**
  - Modified the root `package.json` to include a `start` script (`serve -s dist`)
    for serving the built React application. This ensures Railway can
    correctly serve static assets and handle client-side routing.
  - Confirmed `vite.config.ts` outputs the build to the `dist` directory.
  - Removed irrelevant `vercel.json` configuration as the deployment target
    is Railway, not Vercel.

- **Backend Environment and Seeding:**
  - Ensured `api/index.js` and `api/config/db.js` correctly utilize
    environment variables for database connection.
  - Added a new `api/seed.js` script to create a default admin user. This
    script checks for existing admin users to prevent duplicates and
    securely hashes passwords using `bcryptjs`.
  - Added a `db:seed` script to `api/package.json` for easy execution of
    the seeding process.
  - Included `api/show_admin.js` for verifying admin user data.

- **Dependency Management:**
  - Added `serve` as a dependency to the root `package.json` for static file serving.
  - Ensured all necessary Node.js dependencies are installed in the `api` directory.

These changes address the MIME type error encountered during previous deployments
and provide a robust mechanism for initializing the admin user.

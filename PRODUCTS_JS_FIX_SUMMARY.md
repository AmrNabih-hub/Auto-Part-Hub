## ✅ Resolution

- **Fixed all unescaped apostrophes** by adding backslashes (`\'`)
- **Build now successful** ✅
- **Development server running** ✅
- **No more Vite parsing errors** ✅

## 🎯 Root Cause

The issue occurred because JavaScript string literals use single quotes (`'`) to delimit strings. When an apostrophe appears within a string, it needs to be escaped with a backslash (`\'`) to prevent it from prematurely ending the string.

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ **Build successful**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ **Dev server running**: `npm run dev` starts successfully
- ✅ **Sentry integration**: Both backend and frontend Sentry are working
- ✅ **All features functional**: Ready for development and testing
